## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB database (local or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Local Development

#### 1. Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create a .env file with:
# MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key (optional, for email)
# EMAIL_FROM=your_email_address (optional, for email)
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
# The app will run at http://localhost:5173 (or similar)
```

---

## Deployment

### Backend (Vercel)
- Import the `server/` directory as a new project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
  - `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`
- No build step needed; Vercel uses `vercel.json` and `index.js` as entry point

### Frontend (Netlify)
- Import the `client/` directory as a new project on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- API proxy is pre-configured in `vite.config.js`
- SPA routing and API proxying handled via `netlify.toml`

---

## API Overview

- **Auth:** `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`
- **Jobs:** `/api/jobs` (CRUD, status, queries)
- **Bids:** `/api/bids` (create, update, queries)
- **Users:** `/api/user/profile`, `/api/user/workers`, `/api/user/worker/:id`
- **Reviews:** `/api/reviews` (submit, get by worker/client)

All protected routes require a Bearer JWT token.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- JWT authentication for all protected endpoints
- Role-based access enforced in backend controllers
- CORS restricts API access to frontend domain
- Input validation and error handling throughout
- Environment variables for all secrets and sensitive config

---

## Future Improvements

- Password reset and email verification
- Real-time notifications and messaging
- Admin dashboard and moderation tools
- Payment integration and escrow
- Advanced analytics and reporting
